Codes given are related to new proposed method Dirichlet process mixture of Generalized Multivariate Log-Gamma distributions (DPGMVLG) applied on 25 benchmarking datasets and different methods has been compared to assess 
the performance of these methods based on some external validity indices. 

The codes are distributed in two categories: 

1) DPGMVLG method / Classical methods / Genie method / Descriptive Analysis.

2) DPMNIG codes.
